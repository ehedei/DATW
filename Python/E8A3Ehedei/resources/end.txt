"So why did you tell me?" asked Ender.
"What are you, a smart mouth? Shut up and eat."
Ender shut up and ate. He didn't like Mick. And he knew there was no
chance he would end up like that. Maybe that was what the teachers were
planning, but Ender didn't intend to fit in with their plans.
I will not be the bugger of my group, Ender thought. I didn't leave
Valentine and Mother and Father to come here just to be iced.
As he lifted the fork to his mouth, he could feel his family around him,
as they always had been. He knew just which way to turn his head to look
up and see Mother, trying to get Valentine not to slurp. He knew just
where Father would be, scanning the news on the table while pretending to
be part of the dinner conversation. Peter, pretending to take a crushed
pea out of his nose-- even Peter could he funny.
It was a mistake to think of them. He felt a sob rise in his throat and
swallowed it down; he could not see his plate.
He could not cry. There was no chance that he would be treated with
compassion. Dap was not Mother. Any sign of weakness would tell the
Stilsons and Peters that this boy could be broken. Ender did what he
always did when Peter tormented him. He began to count doubles. One, two,
four, eight. sixteen, thirty-two, sixty-four. And on, as high as he could
hold the numbers in his head: 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192,
16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144. At 67108864 he began to be unsure--
had he slipped out a digit? Should he be in the ten millions or the
hundred millions or just the millions? He tried doubling again and lost
it. 1342 something. 16? Or 17738? It was gone. Start over again. All the
doubling he could hold. The pain was gone. The tears were gone. He would
not cry.
Until that night, when the lights went dim, and in the distance he could
hear several boys whimpering for their mothers or fathers or dogs. He
could not help himself. His lips formed Valentine's name. He could hear
Joe was an asshole
